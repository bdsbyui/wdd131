			<h1>7s4e.org Site Plan</h1>
			<h2>Bryant Smith</h2>
			<h2>WDD 131-A1</h2>
		</header>

    <main>

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
				The purpose of 
				<strong>7s4e.org</strong> 
				is to serve as a site of interest to my family. I am the father in a 
				nuclear family of seven. This number and our testimony of eternal 
				families is the inspiration for alphanumeric sequence 
				<em>7S4E</em>
				, i.e. 
				<em>Seven Smiths Forever</em>
				. The intent to stengthen family identity and cohesion remains the 
				purpose as 
				<a href="https://bdsbyui.github.io/wdd130/7s4e/site-plan.html">
					proposed
				</a> 
				in the original plan for this site.
			</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				My family members as the intended audience is likewise unchanged, except 
				our numbers have increased to eight, and the ninth is on the way!
			</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				The `nav` element for original home page suggest links to several child 
				pages, though only the "Calendar" and "Games" pages were completed. The 
				"Calandar" page displayed a complex travel itinerary for the summer of 
				2023, and it will be excluded from this project. Instead, this project 
				will return to the "Games" page and build out the conceived, but not yet 
				realized, "Recipes" page.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Games:</strong> 
					Last year's effort resulted in the "Wordle" game, and this year's 
					objective will be to make the game more mobile-friendly. However, to 
					newly demonstrate some proficiency in using JavaScript for dynamic 
					elements, I will add a new game, such as Minesweeper.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Recipes:</strong> 
					To ensure that the requirement for "significant textual content" is 
					satisfied, I will also implement the "Recipes" page. This course's 
					recipes project in Unit 5 will clearly benefit this effort. However, 
					for this personal project, I will substantively improve upon the Unit 
					5 assignment by customizing the design and creating click-able tags.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<h4>Heading Font: Arial, Helvetica, or default sans-serif</h4>
			<h4>Paragraph Font: Times New Roman, Times, or default serif</h4>

			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
				commodo consequat.

			<h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>

				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea

			</p>

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Page2</a>
				<a href="#">Page3</a>
			</nav>

			<hr>
			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>
				The home page will consist of a header and a hero section. The header 
				is a icon-based navigation menu exposed by a hamburger button. The hero 
				section consists of a graphic introducing the family with the infinity 
				symbol as a motif to reflect the <em>forever</em> theme.
			</p>
			<p>
				The graphic for the hero section is under development and will employ 
				Canvas, SVG, or some combination of both. Drafts of each are displayed 
				below. For the SVG, I have not yet discoverd how to get the clip path to 
				behave in Chrome and Edge as it does in Firefox. For some reason, with the 
				former browsers, the image is clipped at the x and y limits of the path, 
				but it does not trace the path itself. And in Canvas, I cannot seem to get 
				clipping path to work if the BÃ©zier curve ends where it starts.
			</p>
			<h4>Draft SVG Hero</h4>
			<object
			  class="svg"
				data="../assets/images/infinity.svg"
				type="image/svg+xml"
				aria-label="infinity symbol"
			></object>
			<h4>Draft Canvas Hero</h4>
			<canvas id="canvas" width="1200" height="500">
				<object
					class="svg"
					data="../assets/images/infinity.svg"
					type="image/svg+xml"
					aria-label="infinity symbol"
				></object>
			</canvas>

			<h3>Games Page</h3>
			<p>
				The games page has the play space at it center. Above the play space is the
				name of the active game. Icons to toggle between games is at the bottom of a 
				mobile screen, or along the side on a desktop screen.
			</p>

			<h3>Recipes Page</h3>
			<p>[content, images, data for the subpage]</p>

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about home that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
			</p>
			<img src="#" alt="home page wireframe" />

			<h3>Games</h3>
			<p>
				[Any additional details about page 2 that the wireframe does not make
				clear]
			</p>
			<img src="#" alt="page 2 wireframe" />
