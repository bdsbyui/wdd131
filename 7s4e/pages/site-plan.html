			<h1>7s4e.org Site Plan</h1>
			<h2>Bryant Smith</h2>
			<h2>WDD 131-A1</h2>
		</header>

    <main>
			<hr>
			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
				The purpose of 
				<strong>7s4e.org</strong> 
				is to serve as a site of interest to my family. I am the father in a 
				nuclear family of seven. This number and our testimony of eternal 
				families is the inspiration for alphanumeric sequence 
				<em>7S4E</em>
				, i.e. 
				<em>Seven Smiths Forever</em>
				. The intent to stengthen family identity and cohesion remains the 
				purpose as 
				<a href="https://bdsbyui.github.io/wdd130/7s4e/site-plan.html">
					proposed
				</a> 
				in the original plan for this site.
			</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				My family members as the intended audience is likewise unchanged, except 
				our numbers have increased to eight, and the ninth is on the way!
			</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				The `nav` element for original home page suggest links to several child 
				pages, though only the "Calendar" and "Games" pages were completed. The 
				"Calandar" page displayed a complex travel itinerary for the summer of 
				2023, and it will be excluded from this project. Instead, this project 
				will return to the "Games" page and build out the conceived, but not yet 
				realized, "Recipes" page.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Games:</strong> 
					Last year's effort resulted in the "Wordle" game, and this year's 
					objective will be to make the game more mobile-friendly. However, to 
					newly demonstrate some proficiency in using JavaScript for dynamic 
					elements, I will add a new game, such as Minesweeper.
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Recipes:</strong> 
					To ensure that the requirement for "significant textual content" is 
					satisfied, I will also implement the "Recipes" page. This course's 
					recipes project in Unit 5 will clearly benefit this effort. However, 
					for this personal project, I will substantively improve upon the Unit 
					5 assignment by customizing the design.
				</li>

			<h4>Paragraph Font: Times New Roman, Times, or default serif</h4>

			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>

				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim

			<h3>Navigation</h3>
			<nav>
				<a href="#">Home</a>
				<a href="#">Games</a>
				<a href="#">Recipes</a>
			</nav>

			<hr>
			<h2>Content</h2>
			<h3>Home page</h3>
			<p>
				The home page will consist of a header and a hero section. The header 
				is a icon-based navigation menu exposed by a hamburger button. The hero 
				section consists of a graphic introducing the family with the infinity 
				symbol as a motif to reflect the 
				<em>forever</em> 
				theme. The graphic for the hero section is under development and will 
				employ Canvas, SVG, or some combination of both. Very rough drafts of 
				each are displayed below.
			</p>

			<h4>Draft SVG Hero</h4>
			<object
			  class="hero"
				data="../assets/images/infinity.svg"
				type="image/svg+xml"
				aria-label="infinity symbol"
			></object>
			<p>
				For the SVG, the challenge is that I have not yet discovered how to get 
				the clip path to behave in Chrome and Edge as it does in Firefox. It 
				appears that using a browser other than Firefox results in the image 
				being clipped at the 
				<em>x</em> 
				and 
				<em>y</em> 
				limits of the path, but not along the path of the Bézier curve itself.
		 </p>


			<h4>Draft Canvas Hero</h4>
			<canvas id="canvas" class="hero" width="1200" height="500">
				<object
					class="svg"
					data="../assets/images/infinity.svg"
					type="image/svg+xml"
					aria-label="infinity symbol"
				></object>
			</canvas>
			<svg style="display: none;">
				<path id="infinityLoopPath" d="M 600,250 c -600,600, -600,-600, 0,0 s 600,-600, 0,0" />
			</svg>
			<p>
				As for Canvas, I cannot seem to get clipping path to work if the Bézier 
				curve ends where it starts. If the start and endpoints are the same, it 
				is as if the 
				<em>clip()</em> 
				method has no effect. The bigger challenge, however, is that the 
				animation is proving to be considerably more complex than in the SVG. 
				Un-commented out, the 
				<em>animateJacob()</em> 
				function as currently conceived causes the page to freeze.
			</p>




			<h3>Games Page</h3>
			<p>
				The games page has the play space at it center. Above the play space is 
				the name of the active game. Icons or text to toggle between games is 
				at the bottom of a mobile screen, or along the side on a desktop 
				screen. Games include an improved version of the mostly-working 
				<a href="https://bdsbyui.github.io/wdd130/7s4e/games.html">
					Wordle
				</a> 
				and a to-be-developed implementation of Minesweeper, for which there 
				are many 
				<a href=
					"https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/create-a-minesweeper-game-using-html-css-javascript/"
				>examples online
				</a> 
				which can inform my own version.
			</p>

			<h3>Recipes Page</h3>
			<p>
				The recipes page is a new, to-be-developed implementation of Unit 5's 
				<a href=
					"https://bdsbyui.github.io/wdd131/recipes/index.html"
				>Recipe Book
				</a> 
				with the addition of my own family's recipes.
