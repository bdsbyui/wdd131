			<h1>7s4e.org Site Plan</h1>
			<h2>Bryant Smith</h2>
			<h2>WDD 131-A1</h2>

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>
				The purpose of 
				<strong>7s4e.org</strong> 
				is to serve as a site of interest to my family. I am the father in a 
				nuclear family of seven. This number and our testimony of eternal 
				families is the inspiration for alphanumeric sequence 
				<em>7S4E</em>
				, i.e. 
				<em>Seven Smiths Forever</em>
				. The intent to stengthen family identity and cohesion remains the 
				purpose as 
				<a href="https://bdsbyui.github.io/wdd130/7s4e/site-plan.html">
					proposed
				</a> 
				in the original plan for this site.
			</p>

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>
				My family members as the intended audience is likewise unchanged, except 
				our numbers have increased to eight, and the ninth is on the way!
			</p>

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>
				The `nav` element for original home page suggest links to several child 
				pages, though only the "Calendar" and "Games" pages were completed. The 
				"Calandar" page displayed a complex travel itinerary for the summer of 
				2023, and it will be excluded from this project. Instead, this project 
				will return to the "Games" page and build out the conceived, but not yet 
				realized, "Recipes" page.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<strong>Games:</strong> 
					Last year's effort resulted in the "Wordle" game, and this year's 
					objective will be to make the game more mobile-friendly. However, to 
					newly demonstrate some proficiency in using JavaScript for dynamic 
					elements, I will add a new game: .
				</li>
				<li>
					<strong>Recipes:</strong> 
					To ensure that the requirement for "significant textual content" is 
					satisfied, I will also implement the "Recipes" page. This course's 
					recipes project in Unit 5 will clearly benefit this effort. However, 
					for this personal project, I will substantively improve upon the Unit 
					5 assignment to create click-able tags.
				</li>
