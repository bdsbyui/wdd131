            <h2>Mosiah 4:9-10</h2>
            <p>
                Believe in God; believe that his is, and that he created all 
                things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that his has all 
                wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe 
                that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can 
                comprehend.
            </p>
            <p>
                And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake 
                them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of 
                heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all 
                these things see that ye do them.
            </p>

            <h2>Mosiah 5:13, 15</h2>
            <p>
                For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and 
                who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and 
                intents of his heart?
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, 
                always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God 
                Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to 
                heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal 
                life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of 
                him who created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God 
                above all. Amen.
